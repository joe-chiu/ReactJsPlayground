# ReactJs Playground

I have used React.js at work on a very large application along with several hundreds other people, but have little experience starting from complete scratch. The project I worked on started out as an Angular.js app but migrated to React in a hybrid fasion, so it uses both at the same time. Suffice to say, it's not the most "typical" React set up (if there is ever such a thing). And there are so many variations of tech stack and more coming and going. This series of projects allow me to explore different aspects of React and different ways of doing various things.

# Create a starter without command line (from_scratch_webpack)

Start from the bare essentials - React, Typescript, webpack

# Explore TailwindCSS

Build a starter project with bare essentials to try out TailwindCSS

# Explore Fluent UI 2 + TailwindCSS

My experience with TailwindCSS has been very positive so far, so I adopted it for the next project as well. I was able to stay in JS/JSX with no context switch between world of JS/JSX and the world of CSS. This reminds me of JSX and CSS in JS that allowed us to do more in the JS. And there is no longer a layer of abstraction on what the component is doing layout and presentation wise. I am reserving my judgement on whether this is good in the long run but it's fantastic for prototyping. Now, the main focus of this project is Fluent UI 2 (lib version is v9). Fluent UI 2 provides building block for building Office web apps like Microsoft Teams, or more typically, for building extensions / apps for Microsoft Teams that blend seemlessly into its look and feel and the rest of Office ecosystem. I had fun mocking out a bit of Teams UI with its component library.
